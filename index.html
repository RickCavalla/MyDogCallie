  <p>Rick Cavalla is a software developer who works for an asset management company in Manhattan.
    His daily responsibilities involve maintaining and enhancing a books and records system for 
    Luxembourg-based mutual funds.  The system is almost 30 years, completely character-based, and runs on Solaris.
    It uses a niche relational database with a proprietary language that emphasizes iterative, record-by-record
    processing, not processing entire datasets.
